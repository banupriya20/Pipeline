# Pipeline
For Repository
-questions
**** -how did you test your pipelines?****
     I have tested my pipeline manually first by running each pipeline job in a staging environment and ensure that build steps completed successfully and manully verified the generated ouput file and the CSV file contain the expected data. The syntax of the files was tested using the visual studio code by installing dedugger.  
Suggestions:
     -we can use unit testing &junit testing and continuous intergation to test the pipeline code 
     -We can do unit testing through jenkins pipeline unit library 

**** -how did you test RepoC python?****
     To test this code, I have created a test file with some test cases that exercise the parse_doxygen_warnings_log and write_csv_file functions with some sample input and checked whether the output matches the expected output. It involved by creating a sample warnings.log file and comparing the output CSV file generated by the code.I also debugged and tested this in visual stuido code.
 Suggestions:
    I also consider testing this with Unittesting framework to organize and automate tests.This framework provide utilities for running tests, reporting  the results and handling any failures or errors.

**-what is the advantages to use LFS?**
    Github has limit in pushing large file so inorder to push large files to repo we use git lfs.
In case if we create a 100gb repository, the each clone will download 100gb of data and consume 10gb of disk space on each machine we perform the clone. Placing these big files in a separate system like git-lfs allow you to store only pointors to each version of the file of the repository hence each clone will only download a tiny piece of data for each version
For example, Artifact in pipelineB is a binary file and git tracking of the file is not possible,but using LFS it would be possible to track the file as normal git file

**** -how to adjust this repository to support LFS?****
   -Install the LFS extension on git
   -Modify the newly created .gitattributes in root of the repository to include the file patterns that LFS should track 

      git lfs install
      git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
      git add .gitattributes
      git commit -m "add .gitattributes"
      git push origin main
   -Now when the file matches the pattern is pushed, LFS will takecare of storing the binary files
